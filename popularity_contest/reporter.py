"""
Report list of imported modules to statsd on process exit

In interactive computing installations, figuring out which python
modules are in use is extremely helpful in managing environments
for users.

`setup_reporter` will setup an `atexit` hook, which will
send the list of distributions (libraries) from which packages
have been imported. stdlib and local modules are ignord.
